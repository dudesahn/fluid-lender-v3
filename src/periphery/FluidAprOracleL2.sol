    // then for the rewardsApr we can use the rewards helper contract since we put in totalAssets there...similarly, add or subtract from totalAssets
    // similarly assume that the apr for FLUID rewards will change according to the assets added or removed
    // for the rewardsApr YES use totalAssets, as the supply stuff below is from the liquidity layer which is different
    // for any of the stupid bonus FLUID rewards, similarly use and adjust totalAssets, and also probably discount the APR the API returns by like 10% just to be conservative for price movements, etc.

    // what we need to manipulate
    // supplyRate = borrowRate * (10000 - fee) * borrowWithInterest / supplyWithInterest
